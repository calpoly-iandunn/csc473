## Requirements

There are four components to this project.

1. Implement an additional feature (with instructor approval) for your raytracer.
   Some reasonable ideas can be found below.
2. Provide 2-3 `.pov` files of your own creation that show off your new feature (or are generally visually interesting)
3. Create an HTML website that describes your project and shows some screenshots (and/or videos if appropriate)
4. Demonstrate good software engineering principles in your raytracer

For that last bullet point you have two options:

### Describe Existing Software Design

Describe an abstraction (e.g. set of functions or classes/interfaces) you used in implementing your ray tracer
that was effective at organizing your code, allowing debugging, and/or promoting extensibility.
Point out where this can be found in your raytracer code.

### Refactor For Better Software Design

Refactor a messy part of your raytracer in a way that:

   1. Preserves functionality
   2. Reduces code redundancy
   3. Extracts functionality
   4. Improves testability

Any and all of those attributes are a plus.
Anyone who writes unit tests using a unit testing framework (like [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch), my personal favorite)
will score instant brownie points.

## Documentation

I expect to see some reasonable documentation in your `README.md` of:

1. What feature you chose and why
2. What resources you used to research and implement the feature
3. Explanation/description of your Software Design implementation
