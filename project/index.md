## Overview

Throughout this quarter you will implement the basic functions of a distributed ray tracer.
This software will be enhanced throughout the quarter, thus this initial assignment will serve as the base for following assignments.
Since you will be adding and reusing your code, it is advised that you write your code in a clean, structured object-oriented fashion.
All code must be written in C++.
