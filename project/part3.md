## Overview:

### Goal for assignment 3:

In this assignment you will implement reflection and refraction on mirrored and translucent surfaces.
You will also need to compute intersections with triangles,
and use Beer's law for colored translucent volumes (i.e. spheres).
Please work on these features incrementally using the appropriate files.
For example:

- Start with adding parsing and intersections for **triangles** and use the file `simple_tri.pov` to test your triangle intersections.
- Add **reflections** and test with `simple_reflect1.pov` (reflective plane) and `simple_reflect2.pov` (reflective spheres) and `simple_reflect3.pov` (spheres and planes)
- Add **refractions** (use `simple_refract.pov`)
- Test them all with `recurse_simp2.pov`
- Finally, implement Beer's law and test with `beers.pov`

Reflection and refraction should be implemented via recursion.
Limit the recursion to `6` bounces, but I recommend making that number configurable.
You will be building on to your previous code, and thus, your program should include shading and shadows.

---

In addition to your source code and build files, your repo should also contain:

- Your own `.pov` file and rendered image of a reflective and refractive scene.
  Be creative and create an interesting scene.
  Choose colors and an arrangement of geometry that you find pleasing.


## Program execution:

Your program should have the following syntax:

  `raytrace render <input_filename> <width> <height> [-altbrdf]`

assuming that your executable is named `raytrace` where the options are:

- `input_filename` = the name of the povray file to read and render
- `width` = the image width
- `height` = the image height
- `-altbrdf` = use a brdf other than Blinn-Phong
  **(optional argument)**{: class="text-warning"}

and the command `render` indicates that we simply want to draw the entire scene.

Thus:

  `raytrace render example.pov 640 480`

will render a 640x480 image file, `output.png` consisting of the scene defined in `example.pov` using the Blinn-Phong BRDF for shading.

  `raytrace render example.pov 640 480 -fresnel`

will render a 640x480 image file, `output.png` consisting of the scene defined in `example.pov` including Fresnel reflectance.

Sample input files and images are given in the input files repository.

### Diagnostic/Testing

In addition to the normal execution syntax, your program should support the following diagnostic/testing syntaxes with the given commandline arguments.
You must also continue to support all Diagnostic/Testing syntaxes from the previous iteration(s) of the project.

---

  `raytrace printrays <input_filename> <width> <height> <x> <y> [-altbrdf]`

Prints out information for each iteration of a recursive raytrace.
